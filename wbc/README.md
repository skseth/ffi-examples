# AES Whitebox Cryptography Sample 

This sample tests implementation of white-box AES 256 cryptography.

The first step is generating the whitebox compiler (aes_whitebox_compiler.cc).

The compiler can then be used to generate the whitebox tables for a key (this repo is only focused on AES 256). This is output into a c file aes_whitebox_tables.cc

The actual whitebox object file is generated by then compiling aes_whitebox.cc which includes the aes_whitebox_tables.cc (basically the key), as aes_whitebox.o. This exposes the core AES functions defined in aes_whitebox.h.

# Acknowledgement

This implementation is based on the project https://github.com/balena/aes-whitebox. The following files are obtained from the aes-whitebox site :

Whitebox Compiler
- aes_private.h
- aes_whitebox_compiler.cc

Note: The aes_whitebox_compiler.cc uses the NTL (Number Theory Library), which is hosted at : https://www.shoup.net/ntl/. Note that NTL is LGPLv2.1+ based, which puts obligations on users in terms of sharing software which may be using or based on this library.
